5. Study the code for the BoxBugRunner class. Summarize the steps you would use to add another BoxBug 
actor to the grid.

To add another BoxBug actor to the grid, create the object with the side length wanted. 
     BoxBug newBug = new BoxBug(5);
To add the object to the grid:
     world.add(newBug);
          or
    world.add(new Location(7,6), newBug);
