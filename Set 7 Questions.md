Set 7 Questions: 

1. The methods that are implemented in Critter are act(), getActors(), processActors, getMoveLocations(), selectMoveLocation(), and makeMove().

2. The five basic actions common to all critters when they act are getting a list of actors, processing that list, getting the locations to move to, selecting one of those locations, and moving to that selected location. 

3. Yes, the getActors method can be overridden. For example, this is possible if only one type of actor (such as a rock) needs to be found.

4. A critter could process actors by changing their color, making them move, or eating them. 

5. The methods needed to make a critter move are getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, and makeMove.

6. There is no critter constructor as Critter extends Actor. Since Actor has a default constructor, Critter uses this default constructor.
