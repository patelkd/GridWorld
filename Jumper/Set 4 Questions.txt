1. You can obtain a count of the objects in a grid by using getOccupiedLocatons() while checking all the spots in an array. You can obtain a count of the empty locations in a bounded grid by subtracting the number of spots obtained from getOccupiedLocations() from the total number of grid spaces.
2. To see if (10,10) is in the grid, use boolean isValid (Location loc).
3. The code is not supplied in the methods because the two classes, BoundedGrid<E> and UnboundedGrid<E> implement the interface Grid<E>.
4. No, arrayLists are more useful becaus they do not require the user to set a specific size before filling it. BoundedGrids also do not keep track of the objects, so you do not know how many of them there are.
