Set 2 Questions:

1. The instance variable sideLength sets how far the bug should move horizontally and vertically.

2. The instance variable steps counts the steps the bug has taken to reach sideLength.

3. The turn method is called twice to call two 45 degree turns, which makes a 90 degree turn. This creates the box.

4. BoxBug extends Bug, so the move method is essentially called from the Bug class.

5. No, after a BoxBug is constructed, the size of its square pattern can change if another actor is added to the grid. To avoid intersections, the BoxBug may take a new path.

6. The path a BoxBug travels can change to avoid intersections. With multiple bugs on the grid, each bug can change its path to make its own square with no interference.

7. The value of steps will be equal to zero when the bug is first placed on the grid, and when the bug has to restart its path to make a new square.
